    "## Numerical Convergence Experiments\n",

    "\n",
    "> The idea of convergence is fundamental to numerical techniques. Both your initial conditions and the time-step used in the model affected your final result (your estimate of how close the spacecraft gets to the planet).  In the two experiments the fidelity of your answer improves as (a) the initial spacecraft position was moved to be further away from the planet, and (b) the time step used was decreased.  Explanations for these are below.  The take-home point is you should **always** check in a numerical problem how sensitive your answer is to initial parameters or the temporal or spatial resolution at which you compute your model, to pick choices for these that you can justify.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initial conditions \n",
    "    \n",
    "> You should find that as you increase the distance of the initial $s_{y0}$ coordinate from the planet, the closest approach altitude decreases. The change is large initially but then gets smaller as **the closest approach altitude converges towards a stable answer**.  Although we had set up the algorithm for the numerical integration properly, the initial conditions were incorrect. To accurately assess how close the spacecraft will get to the planet, we need to start our calculation with the spacecraft far enough away from the planet that the gravitational force on the spacecraft due to the planet is negligible. Our initial guess at a starting position of $s_{y0}$ of $-3 R_p$ is not far enough since the gravitational force only falls off as 1 /(distance)$^2$ . You’ll see that an initial value of more than $-300 R_p$ is needed!  In the instructions we said to double the `total_time` each time you increased $s_{y0}$.  What happens if you don’t double $t_f$?  Try it and see. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Time-stepping\n",
    "\n",
    "> In the first exercise you saw that by increasing $s_{y0}$ the solution for the closest approach altitude  converged.  However, it was not converging to the right answer! This was because the time interval, $\\Delta t$ was too long. An implicit assumption in our numerical integration is that over the time interval $\\Delta t$ the gravitational force on the spacecraft remains constant. However in 60 seconds the spacecraft travels approximately 7$*$60 km = 420 km. When the spacecraft is close to the planet the gravitational force changes substantially over this time increment. Thus decreasing the time increment increases the accuracy of the calculations. In practice we found that we need to start a long way from the planet (more than 300 Mercury radii) and use a short time increment. This results in a computationally intensive calculation, and most of the calculations are not needed because they are being done at short time intervals while we are very far away from the planet.  \n"
