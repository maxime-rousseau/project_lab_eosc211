    "Key to writing more complex code successfully (i.e. in reasonable time with minimal frustration) is planning out your algorithm BEFORE starting to code.  Here you will plan out the steps needed to compute a complete spacecraft trajectory given a starting position, velocity, total time of the flyby and the time interval at which you will compute the spacecraft position (and hence velocity and acceleration).  **Read the project_lab1_reading file carefully before attempting this and review the class notes from wk 10 Tuesday.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that there are a series of \"actions\" that are repeated at EACH point along the trajectory (time step). Furthermore each spacecraft position depends on the one before it.  So if you know where it is at time $t = 0$, and you know it's initial speeed, you can compute the spacecraft's acceleration, then for a given time interval $\\Delta t$ you can calculate the change in spacecraft position and velocity using Equations (10)-(13). The new position of the spacecraft after $\\Delta t$ is then the old position plus the change in position; same thing for velocity.\n",

    "The following comments begin to set up the structure for the calculations.  Fill this in as much as possible. You can write it by hand and submit a PDF of a photo or (easier for us to read) write it in a separate notebook that you save as a PDF.   You don't have to write full code but make sure each step you specify is one step that is as precise as possible.  For now, assume you have just one function you will call which is your `grav_acc` function.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Assume you want to make arrays with variable names and shapes as follows that when you are done will contain the quantities specified.  This will enable you to plot e.g. acceleration versus time, position versus time etc. \n",
