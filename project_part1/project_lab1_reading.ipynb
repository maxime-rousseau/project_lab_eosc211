    "## 1.  Background and Motivation\n",
    "This project lab is motivated by the use of flybys of planets / moons in spacecraft missions to alter a spacecraft’s trajectory (flight path). Planetary flybys can be used to not only change the direction of a spacecraft’s\n",
    "motion, but to also alter its speed. Such flybys are often referred to as “gravity assists” because the change to\n",
    "the spacecraft’s motion is enabled by the gravitational force of the planet on the spacecraft. For example, missions to the outer solar system typically use the gravity of Jupiter to provide a “boost” to the spacecraft’s speed,\n",
    "such that the spacecraft can actually make it to the outer solar system. In contrast, missions to the inner solar system typically use the gravity field of one or more planets to slow the spacecraft down enough that it can\n",
    "go into orbit around the desired planet. A good resource describing planetary gravity assists can be found <u>[here](https://www.planetary.org/articles/20130926-gravity-assist)</u>.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will construct a simplified planetary flyby. The simplifications are that we assume an otherwise “straight-line” path of the spacecraft (rather than starting with an elliptical orbit around the sun, or a hyberbolic trajectory into the outer solar system), and we assume that the planet is stationary during the flyby (in practice the planet is of course in an elliptical orbit around the Sun). We will implement a numerical integration algorithm using python to compute a spacecraft’s acceleration, velocity and position as it flys by a planet. This will also demonstrate how you can use python to produce numerical solutions to problems for which there is no simple analytical solution.  The physics that is needed is straightforward first year physics - Newton's second law of motion and Newton's law of gravity, reviewed for this problem below.\n"

    "We have a spacecraft which is about to fly past a planet or moon. We will simplify the problem and look at it in a Cartesian ($x,y$) geometry. The origin of our coordinate system is at the center of the planet (see **Figure 1**). The spacecraft motion is such that if the planet was not there, the spacecraft would be flying with constant velocity in the positive y-direction. Our spacecraft starts out with this velocity at some distance from the planet (bottom of Figure 1).  Far away from the planet the spacecraft has constant velocity (remember Newton’s second law: no net force on the spacecraft implies constant momentum ($m \\vec{v}$), and so constant velocity). As the spacecraft approaches the planet, it experiences a gravitational force due to the planet. \n",

This is a vector quantity and you will resolve the acceleration into its two components using the physics below.\n",

    "In other words, the acceleration means that after a small time, $\\Delta t$, the component of velocity along the y-axis is increased by $a_{y} \\Delta t$, so that the new speed after a time $\\Delta t$, $v_{y}^{\\text {new }}$ is given by $v_{y}^{\\text {new }}=v_{y}^{\\text {initial }}+a_{y} \\Delta t$.
