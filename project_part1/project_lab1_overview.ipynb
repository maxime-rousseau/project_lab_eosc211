    "## 0. Grading\n",
    "**The grade for Project Lab 1 counts 15% toward your course grade.**\n",
    "You have a total of *THREE* weeks to complete the lab.  We have scaffolded the project lab into 3 parts because of the midterm break.  Part 1 should be straightforward and relatively quick to complete, Parts 2 and 3 are more involved. Part 1 is worth 2% of your grade, Part 2 is 5%, Part 3 is 8%.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**The  deliverables for Parts 1 and 2 of the project lab are OPTIONAL**, because of the fall break and midterms in other courses. However, the work for Part 3 depends on the work in Parts 1 and 2, so it is to your advantage to do Parts 1 and 2 and submit the interim deliverables.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "**If you choose to submit Parts 1 and 2 by the deadlines below** we will grade them, return them to you with feedback so that you can use them for Part 3, improving /correcting them if needed.  The final grade for the Project Lab will be based on the Part 3 submission.  We will run any autograding tests performed in Parts 1 and 2 on the Part 3 submission as well as additional tests designed specifically \n",
    "for Part 3.   When you submit Part 3 you will include the functions written in Parts 1 and 2, so if you previously submitted them your grade for these parts will be the same if you didn't change anything or different if you corrected any previous errors.\n",
    "*The exception to this is if you turn in any part that is not your own work whether it is for the optional or final delivery you will receive zero for that part in the final grading e.g. if you turn in a Part 2 optional deliverable that uses AI/google/solution-other-than-your-own you will forfeit that 5% in the overall grade.*  \n",

    "Make sure to work steadily on the project lab starting in Week 10, even if you cannot make one or more of the optional deliverables.  Delaying starting it until the last minute / Week 12 is a (very) bad idea.  If you plan to turn in Part 2 for grading in Week 11, we recommend you start it during Week 10 or the break, because there are no labs in Week 11.  In week 11, even though there are no lab sections, we will, run TA hours at the normal Thursday times.\n",

    "For this project lab, you will write 4 functions as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Part 1** you will write the function `grav_acc` which calculates the gravitational acceleration on the spacecraft at any given point along the trajectory and is at the heart of all the calculations. You will check that it runs successfully by calling it for 3 test cases for which we give you the result.  You will also make a \"top-down\" plan for coding up a full fly-by simulation by writing pseudo-code to plan out your algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Part 2** you will write the remaining functions `checkinit`, `sc_vel_pos_change` and `get_traj`. You will make a figure to verify that you can reproduce a spacecraft trajectory provided. \n",
    "- `get_traj` computes the acceleration, velocity and position vectors along a spacecraft's trajectory and will call three subfunctions: `checkinit`, `grav_acc`, and `sc_vel_pos_change`. \n",
    "- `sc_vel_pos_change` computes the instantaneous change in position and velocity of the spacecraft due to the gravitational acceleration caused by the planet.\n",
    "- `checkinit` checks that your initial spacecraft velocity and position are feasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Part 3** you will write additional script(s) to call `get_traj` for various choices of parameters for starting position / velocity, total duration of flyby and the time step. The script(s) will contain the code to generate the requested figures or output for each investigation.\n",

    "## 4. Important Coding Points:\n",
    "1. **The use of SI units is ESSENTIAL**. Make sure to convert ALL your length, mass and time variables into m, kg and seconds before doing any calculations. For plotting purposes it is more useful to use km, so convert m to km only for plotting.\n",
    "2. **Don't round the output of any calculations, ESPECIALLY inside functions.** Rounding errors propagate and can result in final answers that are quite different (and potentially catastrophic - e.g. your spacecraft crashes when you thought it didn't ...).  Obviously when printing output files or labeling figures rounding calculations to a sensible choice of decimal places (where \"sensible choice\" depends on the situation) is desirable.\n",
    "2. The amount of code required is not huge. For example, my version of `get_traj` contains only 13 lines of code and the subfunctions `grav_acc`, `sc_vel_pos_change`, and `checkinit` contain 5, 3 and 3 lines of code respectively, not including comment and help lines. However, you should be vigilent about being consistent in your use of variable names, and in not generating unecessary variables, otherwise your code (and thinking!) will get out of hand.\n",
    "3. Make sure your code is organized into easily readable, compact coding “blocks”, with appropriate comment lines, and separated by white space.\n",
    "4. All functions must contain docstrings.\n",
    "5. Suppress any extra `print` statements in your notebook that aren't necessary.\n"
